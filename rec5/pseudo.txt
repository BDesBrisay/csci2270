// Deletes a node from a singly linked list

function delete node (param = (node value) or (index))
    place = head
    count = 0

    while place != null
        if (place value = param node value) or (count = param index)
            place prev next = place next
            delete place
            break
        
        count++
        place = place next


// Singly linked list 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 10 -> 2
// delete node at index 4

call function with desired index
place = head and count = 0

checks if place = null, if not
    checks condition to see if index or value of place = param value or index
    if condition is satisfied:
        replace prev node's next connection with next node
        delete current node
        break
    if condition not satisfied
        change current node to next node
